###Instruction for Generate HSMM Annotation

##Step 1: Prepare data

#1. For only interaction period
	Program Name:  interaction_and_wholesession.m
Add the sessions you want to preprocess to the cell “subj_sessions” at line 21. Generally, we set the bin size to 8. If, after processing, a change in human annotation occurs twice within a single bin, the program will automatically try a smaller bin size, such as 7 or 6. If a change occurs, when adding sessions in step 2 and step 3, please remember to fill in the corresponding bin size. Then use selection_vec at line 44 to choose sessions you want to preprocess.  Set “params.portion” as 'interaction', at line 55. Each time the program runs, it will generates results for all interactions in one session.

1-190912-fmpp-zscore0-bin8-relabeled1%:length(mean_activity)-resampled5-2ndM2-subsection0-B.mat
(“2ndF1” means it is a male-female interaction, the interaction sequence is 1st. )

#2. For whole session period
	Program Name:  interaction_and_wholesession.m
Same as instructions above.  Set “params.portion” as 'wholesession', at line 55.  Each time the program runs, it will generates a results for whole session.

##Step 2: Run HSMM model
Program Path:
/home/jmc/Dropbox (NYU Langone Health)/py-hmm-2/scripts/under_instruction
Output Path:
/home/jmc/Dropbox (NYU Langone Health)/py-hmm-2/results/

#1. For only interaction period
	Program name: interaction_and_wholesession.py
Firstly, build a new directory under the output path, then set “run_date” at line 36 as the name of directory. Then, add sessions you want to run HSMM model to “subj_sess” at line 47. Max number of model states can be set at line 136. Run iteration can be set at line 142.

#2. For whole session period
            Program name: interaction_and_wholesession.py
Same as instructions above. But use the “subj_sess” in comment.

##Step 3: Generate Annotation
Program Path:
/home/jmc/Dropbox (NYU Langone Health)/bhv-mfp/hmm-results/HSMMannotation
Output Path:
/home/jmc/Dropbox (NYU Langone Health)/bhv-mfp/hmm-results/HSMMannotation/resultss

#1. For only interaction period and whole session period
	Program name:make_annotation.m
Add the sessions you want to preprocess to the cell “subj_sessions” at line 9, and use “selection_vec
” at line 34 to select them. Choose “Interaction_Type” as you want.
