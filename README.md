In this research work, we utilized two models, namely HSMM and PSID. The corresponding code can be found in folders named 'HSMM' and 'PSID' respectively. We have only provided example code; if you wish to access code for other processing methods described in the paper, please feel free to contact the authors.

## Install
### HSMM
Dependencies:
make sure you have following packages installed:
+1. Anaconda2 or Miniconda2
    note: for Miniconda2, these packages are needed:
            pip install numpy scipy matplotlib cython nose (JMC also add: future, requests; also, may be preferrable use "conda install")
+2. gcc-4.8 g++-4.8
    sudo apt install gcc-4.8 g++-4.8 (JMC: this installation command no longer works, see below; also note that gcc 9.4 should be old enough)
+3. install pybasicbayes
    pip install pybasicbayes

Then you need to get three package dependencies: "hips-lib", "pyhsmm", and "pyhsmm_spiketrains".

### PSID
This part is entirely Matlab programs. Please add 'Source' to the Matlab path. 

The programs in 'Source' are referenced from https://github.com/ShanechiLab/PSID

## Usage

### HSMM
There is an intruction in folder 'HSMM'.

### PSID
+PSID_AcrossSession.m is used to show the prediction results of all sessions of a animal
+male_tracjory is used to plot neural trajectory of "Attack" behavior
+female_tracjory is used to plot neural trajectory of "Mount" and "Thrust" behavior
